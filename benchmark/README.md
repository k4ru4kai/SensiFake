# DeepfakeBench Effort benchmark

`deepfakebench_xception.py` evaluates SensiFake images with DeepfakeBench's
`effort` detector. The filename is historical: this runner does **not** use
the Xception detector. It uses CLIP ViT-L/14 with Effort's trained
classification head.

The benchmark uses the manifest's verified real/fake label as the target and
reports results for:

- the complete evaluated population;
- the `low`, `medium`, and `high` sensitivity levels;
- every `source_dataset` represented in the input manifest;
- every dataset/sensitivity combination that contains images.

For published SensiFake metadata, use
`benchmark/data/sensifake-hf/metadata/sensifake_all.csv`. It contains the
resolved source dataset, source image path, verified authenticity label, and
final sensitivity label.

The evaluator imports the official DeepfakeBench Effort detector. Effort uses
CLIP ViT-L/14 at 224x224 with CLIP normalization. DeepfakeBench is kept outside
this repository.

## Download the Hugging Face dataset

Install or update the Hugging Face CLI if necessary:

```bash
uv tool install huggingface_hub
```

Download the complete published SensiFake dataset into the benchmark data
directory:

```bash
hf download K4ru4k4i/SensiFake \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --local-dir benchmark/data/sensifake-hf
```

The downloaded directory should contain
`benchmark/data/sensifake-hf/metadata/sensifake_all.csv` and the corresponding
image files referenced by that metadata. If the dataset is gated or requires
authentication, log in first:

```bash
hf auth login
```

## Setup

For the repository's local annotation manifest, first build the unified
manifest:

```bash
uv run python scripts/datasets/build_unified_manifest.py
```

Install the benchmark dependencies and obtain DeepfakeBench:

```bash
uv sync --group benchmark
git clone https://github.com/SCLBD/DeepfakeBench.git external/DeepfakeBench
mkdir -p external/DeepfakeBench/preprocessing/dlib_tools
curl -L https://github.com/SCLBD/DeepfakeBench/releases/download/v1.0.0/shape_predictor_81_face_landmarks.dat \
  -o external/DeepfakeBench/preprocessing/dlib_tools/shape_predictor_81_face_landmarks.dat
```

Download the local CLIP model used by Effort:

```bash
uv run hf download openai/clip-vit-large-patch14 \
  --local-dir external/DeepfakeBench/huggingface/clip-vit-large-patch14
```

DeepfakeBench release `v1.0.1` does not include a pretrained Effort detector
checkpoint. Provide a compatible Effort checkpoint yourself, or train Effort
first, and put it in `external/DeepfakeBench/training/weights/`. Do not use
`xception_best.pth`: it is a different architecture. The checkpoint must
match the CLIP ViT-L/14 Effort model.

## Running the benchmark

The benchmark includes defaults for the published Hugging Face dataset,
DeepfakeBench checkout, local CLIP model, Effort checkpoint, and output
directory. After setup, run it from the repository root in Bash or WSL with:

```bash
uv run python benchmark/deepfakebench_xception.py
```

The default command uses:

- `benchmark/data/sensifake-hf/metadata/sensifake_all.csv`;
- `external/DeepfakeBench`;
- `external/DeepfakeBench/huggingface/clip-vit-large-patch14`;
- `external/DeepfakeBench/training/weights/effort_clip_L14_trainOn_sdv14.pth`;
- `benchmark/results/deepfakebench-effort-hf`.

All paths remain configurable if a different manifest, model, checkpoint, or
output directory is needed. For example, run with the repository's local
annotation manifest:

```bash
uv run python benchmark/deepfakebench_xception.py \
  --annotations annotations/human-train-v0/automatic_annotation/sensifake_complete_sensitivity.csv \
  --output benchmark/results/deepfakebench-effort-local
```

The `--device` option accepts `cpu` or `cuda`. If it is omitted, CUDA is used
when available. Useful options include `--batch-size`, `--detector-config`,
`--mean`, and `--std`. Run `--help` to see all options.

## Metrics and outputs

Outputs are written to the directory passed with `--output` (the default is
`benchmark/results/deepfakebench-effort`). The full prediction CSV and JSON
contain `content_hash`, `image_path`, `source_dataset`,
`sensitivity_level`, `label`, and `probability_fake`.

The benchmark reports accuracy, balanced accuracy, fake precision, fake recall,
fake F1, ROC-AUC, real/fake counts, and the `tn`/`fp`/`fn`/`tp` confusion
matrix. The fixed classification threshold is `P(fake) >= 0.5`.

It also reports **sensitivity-weighted accuracy**, which gives each sample a
weight based on the sensitivity of its content:

| Sensitivity | Weight |
|---|---:|
| low | 1 |
| medium | 2 |
| high | 3 |

The metric is:

```text
sensitivity_weighted_accuracy =
    sum(sample_weight × correct_prediction) / sum(sample_weight)
```

Consequently, an error on high-sensitivity content affects the score three
times as much as an error on low-sensitivity content. This complements
ordinary accuracy rather than replacing it: report both when comparing
detectors, because the sensitivity-weighted score reflects the application's
risk priorities while ordinary metrics remain directly comparable.

Generated reports include:

- `low/`, `medium/`, and `high/` directories with predictions, metrics,
  confusion matrices, and probability plots;
- `datasets/` with a prediction CSV and metrics JSON for every
  `source_dataset` in the manifest;
- `datasets_metrics.json` and `datasets_metrics.csv` with per-dataset
  accuracy, balanced accuracy, fake precision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC, and class
  counts;
- `dataset_metrics.png`, comparing all classification metrics, including
  sensitivity-weighted accuracy, across source datasets;
- `dataset_class_counts.png`, showing the real/fake composition of each source
  dataset;
- one `confusion_matrix_<dataset>.png` per source dataset;
- `dataset_sensitivity_metrics.json` and
  `dataset_sensitivity_f1_heatmap.png`, showing how fake F1 changes across
  datasets and sensitivity levels;

The output layout is approximately:

```text
<output>/
├── predictions.csv
├── predictions.json
├── metrics.json
├── datasets_metrics.csv
├── datasets_metrics.json
├── dataset_sensitivity_metrics.json
├── dataset_metrics.png
├── dataset_sensitivity_f1_heatmap.png
├── dataset_class_counts.png
├── confusion_matrix_<dataset>.png
├── low/ | medium/ | high/
└── datasets/<dataset>/
```

Dataset names are sanitized when used as directory or filename components.
If an older manifest does not provide `source_dataset`, results are grouped
under `unknown`.
